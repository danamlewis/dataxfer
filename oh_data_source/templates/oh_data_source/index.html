<h2>About Open Humans</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/">Open Humans</a> is a nonprofit
  project that has been funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and
  Knight Foundation. Their platform enables members to aggregate data and
  share data with researchers and citizen scientists.
</p>
<p>
  Data is private by default in Open Humans. You choose when to share.
  Members can decide to make data public, or can contribute it directly
  (and privately) to projects created by researchers and citizen
  scientists.

<h2>Technical details</h2>
<p>
  This app does not receive access to any identifying information from
  your Open Humans account, and does not store any data locally. The app
  deposits data into your Open Humans account associated with the
  <a href="{{ oh_proj_page }}">"Nightscout Data Transfer"</a> activity.
</p>
<p>
  Raw data is JSON format, retrieved from your Nightscout server. You'll
  have access to data files in the Open Humans activity page:
  <a href="{{ oh_proj_page }}">{{ oh_proj_page }}</a>
</p>
